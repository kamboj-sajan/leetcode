**Difficulty:** Medium  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-bitwise-or-from-grid/)

---

You are given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `m x n`.

You must select **exactly one** integer from each row of the grid.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum possible bitwise OR** of the selected integers from each row.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,5],[2,4]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

- Choose 1 from the first row and 2 from the second row.
- The bitwise OR of `1 | 2 = 3`​​​​​​​, which is the minimum possible.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[3,5],[6,4]]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

- Choose 5 from the first row and 4 from the second row.
- The bitwise OR of `5 | 4 = 5`​​​​​​​, which is the minimum possible.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[7,9,8]]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

- Choosing 7 gives the minimum bitwise OR.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m == grid.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= n == grid[i].length <= 10^5`
- `m * n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5​​​​​​​`
